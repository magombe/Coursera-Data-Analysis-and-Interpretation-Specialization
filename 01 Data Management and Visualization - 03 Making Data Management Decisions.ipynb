    "For the next step in my data analysis project, I needed to code out several rows in my data set for which data is not available. For example, the variable for internet user rate for Taiwan is simply a blank cell with no data recorded; I replaced all of these non-values with a Numpy NaN. The second data management step I took was to bin the data into ten bins (except for the polity score, which was recorded in integer values from -10 to 10, resulting 21 bins). This will allow me to print a frequency distribution, or  a histogram later on.\n",
